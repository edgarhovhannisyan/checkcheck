# https://chess-vision.com is a simple chess training website for beginner to intermediate level chess players to practice chess vision. 3 Options are available.

1. Finding all checking moves in a given position for the active player
2. Finding all capturing moves in a given position for the active player
3. Finding all undefended pieces in a given position for the active player

The project heavily relies on two js libraries

chessboard.js and chess.js.

All initial positions are taken from lichess puzzles' open database

Happy training!!!
